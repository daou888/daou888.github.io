## 【A GUI based program for making customised crypto stealing malware written in python

AS OF 13th OCTOBER 2024 IT IS BROKEN, I WILL NOT BE FIXING IT
AS OF 08/10/2025 I PLAN TO REWRITE THIS PROGRAM AND IMPROVE IT
raccoon crypto clipper written in python
supports bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, monero, solana, dogecoin, ripple, tron, bitcoin cash
Documentation Maintenance GitHub issues

A GUI based builder for making custom crypto stealing malware
GUI AND MALWARE DESIGNED FOR WINDOWS COMPUTERS - ANY OTHER SYSTEM WONT RUN

features
gui features

written with customtkinter, CTkToolTip and hPyT
uses pyarmor for obfuscating malware and pyinstaller for compiling to .exe
allows setting custom icons to the malware .exe
allows setting custom name for the malware .exe
has documentation built into the GUI under the documentation tab
malware features

supports Bitcoin, bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Solana, Dogecoin, Ripple, Tron at the same time
six different types of the same malware but using different methods. subprocess, ctypes and pyperclip
tkinter uses the tkinter libary - fully python standard libary so no pip installs (is fastest + best on old/shit hardware)
subprocess uses powershell commands to read and set clipboard - uses python standard libary so no need for the target to install anything
ctypes uses ctypes to read clipboard and powerhsell to set clipboard - uses python standard libary so no need for the target to install anything
pyperclip uses the pyperclip module to read and set clipboard - requires the target the run the command pip install pyperclip
clipboard is literally a reskin of pyperclip - requires the target the run the command pip install clipboard
win32clipboard uses the libary pywin32 - requires the target the run the command pip install pywin32
duplicates and adds itself to startup apps (registry) for persistence under a different name
has single use method
allows discord webhook (whenever a address is detected you get a discord notification which says the computer name and that the address has been changed), doesnt need any installs as uses http.client rather than requests to send POST requests to webhook
option to ping @everyone
malware saved as .pyw and then compiled to .exe meaning that the malware runs in the background silently
has a 4 restart incubate feature
has a ignore feature (to not run on computers with a given computer name)
features i will want to add in the future

 more supported crypto currencies
 get public ip and define method with webhook
 self check to avoid multiple instances
 file extention spoofer
 file size pumper
 base64 encodeding + exec
 another obfuscation method and compile method to choose from
 duplicate file cleaner (when the persistent file is cteated remove its icon to make less obvious in startup apps)
 self exclude from av (requires run from admin)
 anti virtual machine
 process injection???? - maybe on this one, no idea how it works
 exclude - (exclude specific computer names and so on)
 incubate (only starts running after 4 restarts)
 second file persistence (if the first persistent file is removed successfully the second one will run - will be stored separately from main persistence files)
 improve reset
 add fake error
 add decoy programs
 new error method to replace ctkmessagebox

installation
git clone https://github.com/3022-2/raccoon_clipper.git

cd raccoon_clipper

pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.pyw or double click main.pyw
how to uninstall malware
kill the process in task manager and delete .exe
run uninstaller.py in uninstaller folder - if there is an error removing registry entry (cant find path) this is fine it means it isnt in startup anyway
you can also manual uninstall

kill the process in task manager and delete .exe
goto %appdata%
delete storage0 folder and CLPPTH folder
goto Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
delete entry named CLPPTH
